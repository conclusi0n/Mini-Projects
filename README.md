# Mini-Projects

Welcome to the **Mini-Projects** repository! ðŸŽ‰

This repository includes a series of small, self-contained programs written in Python and C. The goal is to demonstrate a variety of concepts in programming, including file handling, user input/output, and more. Each project is designed to be simple, educational, and easy to understand.

### Projects Included:

1. **ATM Simulation** (Python & C):
   - Simulates a basic ATM where users can insert a card, check balance, and withdraw cash.
   - Account details are stored in a text file, and the file is updated with withdrawals.

2. **Email Sender** (Python):
   - Sends mass emails to a list of recipients stored in an XML file. Perfect for a basic subscription system.

3. **Unit Converters** (Python & C):
   - Convert between different units of distance, weight, and more. The user is prompted to select the type of conversion.

4. **Task Tracker** (Python & C):
   - A simple task tracker where users can add, edit, and delete tasks. Tasks are saved in a file, and the program allows users to track and manage their to-dos.

5. **Contact Book** (Python):
   - A contact book program that stores and retrieves contact details, even after restarting the program, by saving the data to a file.

6. **Number Guessing Game** (Python & C):
   - A simple number guessing game where the user has to guess a random number generated by the program.

7. **Basic Calculator** (Python & C):
   - A simple calculator that supports basic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

8. **Alarm Clock** (Python):
   - A basic timer/alarm clock where the user can set a timer and get notified when it finishes.

9. **Basic GUI Calculator** (Python):
   - A simple graphical user interface (GUI) calculator built using the Tkinter library.

10. **Basic CLI Calculator** (Python):
    - A command-line interface (CLI) calculator for performing basic arithmetic operations.
